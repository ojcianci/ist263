    <h1>Olivia Ciancio's Biography</h1>

    <p>
My name is <strong>Olivia Ciancio</strong> and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University. I am a dual major in Advertising in the Newhouse School and 
Information Management and Technology in the School of Information Studies. I am a marketing minor in the Whitman School of Management.
    </p>
    <p>
I am on the Syracuse University English Equestrian Team and I am a member of a panhellenic sorority. I am also a member of the Junior Panhellenic Council.
I am an editor and design the formatting and cover for my sorority's alumni newsletter. I also write for Zipped Magazine and The Daily Orange. 
I am also a member of the Women's Network at Syracuse and am looking to get involved in so much more. 
    </p>

    <p>
As far as future goals go for my major, I would love to work in the beauty and/or fashion industry and do some kind of communications related thing for that industry. 
I am very work oriented but I have kind of a work hard, play hard mentality so while academics are very important to me, I am also a very social person as well.
I loved to be involved and engaged! Skills of mine include time management, organization, and communication.
