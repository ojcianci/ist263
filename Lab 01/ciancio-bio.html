My name is Olivia Ciancio. I am a sophomore at Syracuse University. I am a dual major in Advertising at the S.I Newhouse School of Public Communications and Information management and Technology in the School of Information Studies. I also have a minor in Marketing in the Whitman School of Management. I’m interested in digital advertising, as well as social media. Outside of school, I’m an equestrian and a member of the Syracuse University English Equestrian Team and I enjoy skiing as well. My favorite shows include Schitt’s Creek, Sopranos, and anything similar to Dateline
