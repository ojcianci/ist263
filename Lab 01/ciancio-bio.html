     <body>
My name is Olivia Ciancio and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University. I am a dual major in Advertising in the Newhouse School and 
Information Management and Technology in the School of Information Studies. I am a marketing minor in the Whitman School of Management.
I am on the Syracuse University English Equestrian Team and I am a member of a panhellenic sorority. I also write for Zipped Magazine and 
The Daily Orange. I am also a member of the Women's Network at Syracuse and am looking to get involved in so much more. As far as future goals go for 
my major, I would love to work in the beauty and/or fashion industry and do some kind of communications related thing for that industry.
Hobbies of mine include competitive equestrian, skiing, hanging out with friends, and baking.
